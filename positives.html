        <h2>Credit Cards</h2>
            <p>
                Thanks to computers, credit cards become very popoular among the general public 
                due to their accessibility and convenience, enabling everyone to shop and manage 
                their money without carrying around larges amounts of cash.
            </p>
            <p>
                Credit cards provide a useful record of purchasing history, making it easier for 
                consumers to manage their finances and track their purchases.
            </p>
            <p>
                Credit cards can also offer fraud protection, reducing the risk of financial loss 
                due to unauthorized, unwanted transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not to mention, credit cards have played a significant role in stimulating consumer 
                spending and driving economic growth, due to the fact that people can make purchases
                beyond their immediate financial means.
            </p>
        <h2>Online Banking</h2>
            <p>
                Online banking has made it easy for individuals to perform various banking activities, 
                such as checking account balances, transferring funds, paying bills, and applying for 
                loans, all from the comfort of their homes using computers.
            </p>
            <p>

                decisions, which reduces the likelihood of errors and other discrepancies.
            </p>
            <p>
                With online banking, there is no need to visit physical banks, which saves customers 
                time and money. It also eliminates the need for physical cash and checks. 
            </p>
        <h2>Mobile Banking</h2>
            <p>
                Similar to online banking, mobile banking has made accessing finances incredibly easy. Banks
                make it simple for users to use apps on their phones or tablets to manage their accounts. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Mobile banking apps have enhanced secruity features that protect user data. This includes 
                features like fingerprint and facial recognition, secure login credentials, and encryption 
                protocols. 
            </p>
        <h2>Regulations</h2>
            <p>
                The online banking world has been subject to stringent regulations and restrictions to ensure the 
                security and privacy of customers' financial information, including encryption, verification 
                services, and regular audits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Online banks impose strict rules on online banking institutions to prevent money laundering, 
                fraud, and other illicit activities. Banks will also use transaction monitoring systems to detect 
                and report suspicious transactions.
            </p>
        <h2>Business</h2>
            <p>
                Online banking has streamlined financial transactions and reduced administrative 
                overheads, saving businesses' time and money.</p>
            <p>
                Businesses get access to real-time financial information, allowing them to make informed 
                decisions and improve financial management.
            </p>
            <p>
                Online banking has expanded businesses' reach by enabling secure and convenient online 
                payment options, facilitating global transactions and opening doors to new markets.
