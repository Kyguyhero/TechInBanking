        <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>
                Despite the numerous regulations put in place to safeguard customers, like Regulation 
                E which protects users when they utilize elctronic funds, there are still significant 
                risks that customers face while online.
            </p>
            <p>
                The increased reliance on computers and digital systems in banking has exposed financial 
                institutions to a higher risk of cybersecurity threats. Hackers and cybercriminals 
                continuously target banks to gain unauthorized access to sensitive customer data, 
                commit fraud, or disrupt operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, with the digitization of banking, the potential for data breaches 
                and privacy breaches has increased. If banks fail to implement robust security 
                measures, they may be vulnerable to data breaches that expose customer information, 
                including personal and financial details.
            </p>
        <h2>Internet Reliance</h2>
            <p>
                Banking continues to grow increasingly reliant on technology, which means that technology 
                has to work consistently or customers face issues that can lead to backlash and loss of business.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the event of system outages or prolonged downtime, customers may experience disruptions in 
                accessing their accounts, making transactions, or accessing customer support. These interruptions 
                can lead to frustration, inconvenience, and potential financial losses for both banks and customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                While computers and digital banking have made financial services more accessible to many, 
                there are still segments of the population, particularly older individuals, who may face 
                challenges in adapting to digital banking platforms. This digital divide can lead 
                to financial exclusion and hinder access to banking services for certain demographics.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, technology has reduced the need for face-to-face interactions with bank tellers 
                and other employees. This makes it difficult to address complex financial needs and other issues.
